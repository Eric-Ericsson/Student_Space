          <p>
            <span>
              The Coca-Cola logo hasn't changed much since its early beginnings
              and pretty much everyone in the world recognizes it. It's so
              memorable that the logo has inspired fonts and the color is commonly
              known as Coca-Cola red. Similarly, the McDonald's logo, with
              its famous and memorable golden arches is known the world over. You
              don't even need to see the word "McDonald's" to recognize the
              arches.

            <span>
              Before you create a new business logo, it’s imperative that you
              first settle on the brand identity and the story behind it. A
              large part of your brand identity is the emotion it transmits. This
              is called emotional branding and its foundation is based on
              storytelling and your brand values. It's highly important to apply
              emotional branding to your business logo and all creative assets.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Emotional branding has many benefits for your business, such
              as:

            <span>
              Finding your brand identity takes time and dedication, here below we
              have listed some key questions you should consider to create your
              brand identity:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>What pain point does your brand solve for people? </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              Your brand must solve something specific in your audience. By
              targeting a specific problem in their life or work, you can create a
              brand identity around that.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Who are the people you are solving this pain point for? </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              Who exactly is your target audience? The more specific you can get,
              the better. What is their age range? Where do they live? What are
              their normal days like?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Why did you create this brand and company? </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              Look deep inside the reason why you built your company. Was it to
              solve a need you yourself had? Were you looking for ways to help a
              specific sector of people? Tapping into your "why" is a great way to
              define a brand identity.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>What are your brand values? </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              Your brand values are the basis of how you work and offer your
              products or services. It's also the foundation for your work
              environment, employees and supplier. Having concrete brand values
              keeps your organization in line with your brand and your "why."
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>
                How does your personal story fit into the creation of this brand?{" "}
              </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              Storytelling is a large part of brand identity. It's highly common
              for a founder's personal story to intertwine with their brand story.
              Most often than not, the business was ideated out of a personal need
              or of someone close to them. Is this your case? If so, use it as a
              storytelling foundation for your brand identity.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>What emotion does your brand inspire in people? </b>
            </span>
            <span>
              When your brand is encountered out in the world, what emotion should
              it evoke? Tap into that and analyze how it can be applied to the
              brand's story.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Once you know the answer to these questions, you can create a brand
              identity and tap into emotional branding. This forms the foundation
              for the creation of your logo. When your designers have this
              information to work with, they will create a better logo that will
              match your brand identity.

            <p>
              <span>
                If you don’t know what you want your logo to look like, it’s easy
                to find ideas and inspiration, but from where do you start?
              </span>
            </p>
            <h3>
              <span>Brainstorm logo ideas</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                First, brainstorm ideas. The most important rule of brainstorming
                is to get all the ideas out without judgment. Even if it sounds or
                looks horrible, get it out there. You never know what may spark
                the idea that leads to "the one." 
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                It's best if you can work with a few other people at this stage.
                You'll all want to put yourself into the shoes of your target
                audience and think about how you want them to see you. Make a list
                of words that describe how you want the company to be
                perceived. 
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                Also, write down concepts that could help you get across your
                desired perception. For example, if your product is an app that
                helps people to slow down videos, you could brainstorm images that
                represent slow like a snail or a turtle. Once you have a clear
                definition and a sizeable list of ideas, take a break for a day or
                two. Then, come back with a fresh set of eyes.

            <h3>
              <span>Create a vision board </span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                Meanwhile, the next step is to create a vision board (also called
                mood board or inspiration board). A vision board is a collection
                of images, like a collage, that helps visually communicate the
                look and feel that you want for your logo. This helps ensure that
                everyone is on the same page. 
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                Why is it so important? Because you can verbally explain an idea
                and every team member will likely have a different mental image of
                what it looks like. When you create a visual board, everyone
                involved can see how the idea translates into imagery. It
                clarifies the vision, makes collaboration easier, and can help to
                save you time by getting you to the right logo faster.

                In short, you'll browse the internet for images and combine them
                all in one place. An easy way to do this is by creating a private
                Pinterest board that you share with your team. Here are a few
                guidelines on what images you should collect:
              </span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  <span>
                    <b>Logotype</b>
                    : There are various types of logo designs including a
                    wordmark, emblem, pictorial mark, letter mark, combination,
                    mascot, and abstract design. Browse logos from other companies
                    and add the ones that you would like to use as inspiration.
                  </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <span>
                    <b>Typography </b>
                    (fonts): Browse fonts and add photos of fonts that you think
                    would best represent your brand. 
                  </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <span>
                    <b>Color</b>
                    : You'll want to show the colors that you'd like the logo to include. You can do this through imagery that includes the colors or
                    color palettes.
                  </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <span>
                    <b>Style</b>
                    : Look for photos that express the style you would like for
                    your logo. For example, if you are going for a vintage feel,
                    you may have retro-style images.
                  </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span>
                Aim for a vision board with 35-40 images. This will give you
                enough images to provide guidance for the design but not too many
                where it's overwhelming. You can also have different team members
                create their own vision boards and then you come together to
                combine the images that you all agree are best.

              <span>
                Lastly, check your competitors. Collect the logos from various
                competitors and analyze them. What style, typography, type,
                imagery, and color scheme did they use? What do you like and what
                don't you like? How can your logo stand out in your industry?
                You'll want to sit down with your team and discuss the answers to
                these questions.

            <span>
              A crucial aspect to consider when creating a logo is its visual
              aesthetic. Your brand and your logo are one entity and must be in a
              visual union. For example, if your company is a vintage clothing and
              trinkets shop, your business logo should have some sort of vintage
              feel to it. The visual perception of the design of your logo must
              match what your business and brand are about.

              Logos come in different styles. From just a word to an icon or image
              with a word to a full emblem. The choice of which type of logo to use depends on where you want to use your logo and for what capacity. A
              well-designed logo strategy includes two or three versions to use in
              different ways.

              Most designers will start with a combination mark that can be
              separated into a wordmark and abstract mark or a lettermark and a
              pictorial mark. Let's look at the different types of logos.

            <span>7. Understand the meaning behind logo colors</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
              The colors used in the design of your business logo are extremely
              important. Colors trigger emotions and perceptions, both personally and
              culturally. The color you use in your logo must match your
              brand identity and it needs to be the right shade of that color.
              Yellow, for example, is bright and inspirational when it's a sunny
              yellow but can be off-putting if it's leaning towards ochre or a
              sickly yellow.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Color combinations also carry a lot of weight. Be mindful of how you use two or three colors together. Many color
              combinations carry a perception that is hard to shake. For example,
              green and red are Christmas colors, red, white, and blue remind you
              of the United States flag, and orange and black are reserved for
              Halloween.</span>
          </p>

            <span>The psychology of color in logo design</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span>
              Let's look at the psychology of how colors are perceived
              in logos.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Red </b>
              is highly noticeable and impactful. It makes an impression. The
              color red evokes feelings of passion, excitement, and power but will
              also evoke danger and caution. The perception changes with the
              shapes and words used around it.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Orange </b>
              logos are generally cheerful and vibrant. The shade of orange used
              is really important as there is a short range of orange shades that
              evoke positive feelings. If using orange, keep it vibrant and happy.
              Don't mix it with black unless you are a Halloween products
              company.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Blue, dark and vibrant </b>
              is classic colors for corporate logos, while more neutral blues are
              common in the health sector. Blue is a dependable color that is well
              perceived all around.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Yellow </b>
              logos are not very common, so it will call attention to your logo
              straight away. Nevertheless, yellow isn't suitable for all types of
              businesses. It's typically more of a lighthearted happy color. Stay
              away from yellows that look sickly or too green.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Brown </b>
              is one of the least used colors for logos, but that doesn't mean you
              shouldn't use it. Use a shade of brown that looks more like
              chocolate or coffee and stay away from green-toned browns. Brown
              works well with natural, organic products with sustainable packaging
              design.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Green </b>
              is used by most organic or ecologically minded brands. This is so
              common that consumers expect it if you have an environmental aspect
              of your business. If your business is in that niche, you're better
              off going with green in your logo so that consumers will associate
              it with instantly. Stay clear of the red and green combination
              unless your business is related to Christmas.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Pink </b>
              is one of the most gendered colors for logos. The majority of
              feminine brands use pink in logos and branding. Go with pink if you
              want your brand to fit in that space. But if you want to stand out
              and appeal to anyone that identifies as a woman, choose another
              color.

          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Purple </b>
              is commonly known as a royal or spiritual color. It's widely used in
              the health and wellness field and also in the feminine industry.
              Using purple in an industry that doesn't fit those niches is risky
              but if well done can be successful and memorable.

            <span>8. Choose your logo font</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>Similar to color psychology, logo fonts also carry emotions and perceptions. The fonts in your business logo must carry on your brand
              identity just like the colors and visuals. Choosing the right logo
              font is similar to the way you choose the logo style. Different
              types of fonts carry their own visual style.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Here are the most common types of fonts your designer can use:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Serif fonts: </b>
              These are fonts with letters that have little extensions at the
              ends. Serif fonts are elegant and generally easy to read. Depending
              on the size of their serifs (the little extensions), they can be
              feminine, masculine, or gender-neutral.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Sans Serif fonts: </b>
              The opposite of the above, the letters in these fonts don’t have
              extensions at the end. Sans serif fonts are easy to read and
              generally carry fun and easy-going appeal. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Slab fonts: </b>
              Fonts with thick sans serif letters in a very heavy style are called
              slab fonts. This style of typography works really well for a logo as
              long as the brand identity matches the feeling it evokes. A low
              heavy slab font can represent dependability and confidence.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Script fonts: </b>
              Calligraphy and handwritten fonts are made up of connected letters,
              much like the script we use to write. Script fonts are the
              typography of choice for signature fonts but can also be combined
              with a sans serif or serif for a combined logo style.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              <b>Novelty fonts: </b>
              Novelty fonts, also called display fonts, carry a heavy cultural or
              creative impact. These are the most difficult fonts to use for a
              logo. Only use a novelty font if it makes sense with your brand
              identity. If you choose this route, a designer can create a novelty
              font for your logo that perfectly captures your brand message.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              By using the psychology of fonts, you can start to narrow down your
              font options. For instance, Sans Serif fonts are perceived as stable, clean, and modern, while Serif fonts are traditional, respectable, and reliable. Now, think
              about the unique brand identity that you established earlier in the
              process and decide which font category most closely represents that
              identity.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              You can give that category to your designer and let them present you
              with several font options with similar logo designs to see how the
              font works with the rest of your logo, or you can narrow down your
              font options even further with some of these methods:

            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Try a larger font database like Google fonts or the fonts library to find a font that is more unique to your brand.</span>

                  Keep an eye out for fonts you like on websites, posters, or
                  signs you run into during your day-to-day activities. Use a font finder tool to identify the fonts you like to give your designer
                  ideas.

              You may also consider giving your designer a few fonts to use as
              inspiration and ask them to create a custom font that will be
              entirely unique to your brand, helping you stand out even
              more.

            <span>9. Design your logo</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
              Now it's about time to get your logo designed, if you don't have an
              in-house designer then you are left with three options:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span>You can work with a design agency</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                  You can design the logo yourself using a logo maker tool
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>You can hire a freelance logo designer</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              Working with a design agency can definitely be very expensive, so
              let's focus on the two other options available.
            </span>
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span>Using a logo maker tool</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span>
              A logo maker is the cheapest solution you can choose from, the only
              limitation is that they all are 100% software-driven. There is no
              human interaction whatsoever behind them, therefore apart from being
              able to choose some basic design preferences, you don't have much
              more customization options available
            </span>
            <span>.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              We might sound biased in saying this, but the reason why Fiverr's
              logo maker works differently is that the logo solutions you are
              provided with are based on a wide selection of logo designs made by
              designers on Fiverr.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But that's not all! The nice part is that if you wish to further
              customize it, you simply can request the designer of your logo to
              customize it for you.

            <span>
              To evaluate the different logo options your designer provides you
              with, the best and easiest option you have, it's to get feedback
              from your friends, family members, or co-workers. The more people
              see and comment on your logo, the best.

              That said a good logo has some very specific characteristics:

              11. Important mistakes you should avoid when designing a logo
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
              There are a number of common mistakes that turn logos into failures,
              and it's important to keep them in mind from the beginning so you
              won't have to redo your work later. Here’s a list of the mistakes
              you need to steer away from.
            </span>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
                <span>
                  <b>Copying another business’s logo. </b>
                </span>
                <span>
                  Never copy a logo from another business. Being inspired by
                  someone else’s logo is fine, just don’t copy it. If consumers
                  and clients see your logo and instantly think “Hey, that looks
                  like that other logo," you have a problem. Another angle
                  about copying other logos is the use of AI-generated
                  logos or using a logo maker. Putting a random icon together with
                  a bit of text will make your logo look like a million other
                  logos out there. When you communicate with your designer, make
                  sure it’s clear what type of icons they will use. Will it be a
                  sourced visual or will they custom design it? Your logo is the
                  most visible part of your business, make it as unique as
                  possible.

                    Not taking into account cultural and sociological nuances.{" "}
                  </b>
                </span>
                <span>
                  Another common error that can make a logo fail is not
                  taking into account cultural and sociological nuances. For
                  example, the location where you do business, be it local or
                  international, is an important aspect to consider when creating
                  a logo. Don’t use a symbol that you like without knowing what it
                  means. It might be religious imagery or carry a cultural
                  connotation that could cause confusion or a negative or even
                  offensive impression in some places. A common mistake involving
                  sociological nuances has to do with the placement of elements in
                  logo design. What might look to you like an adult holding a
                  child protectively can be misconstrued as something else. These
                  are technically innocent mistakes but can cost you many
                  headaches later. To avoid this mistake, simply be vigilant, and
                  conscious and check all the visuals with people from diverse
                  backgrounds.

                  <b>Forgetting to consider the consumer. </b>
                </span>
                <span>
                  It’s common for business owners to like a logo design so much
                  that they forget the importance of how the consumer perceives
                  it. Remember that the logo is for your clients, not for you.
                  This mistake is most common among amateur designers who are
                  concerned more with final aesthetics rather than the message it
                  conveys.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
              Once your logo is finalized it's time to integrate it into your
              branding material. Your logo should be added to every visual aspect
              of your business brand, from email headers to printed flyers and
              posters. The versatility of your logo depends on how many versions
              it has. If your logo has a wordmark, a pictorial mark, and a
              combination mark, they can be used interchangeably in different
              assets.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Below are some examples of how and why to integrate your logo design
              into your branding material:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                Your business cards need to have your logo on it, not just your name and contact
                  details. A business card is easily the no.1 branding asset when
                  it comes to meeting people in person. Every person in your
                  company should have their own card with the logo on it.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                  Letterheads must have your logo at the top (and in other
                  creative ways) so that every letter you send out will be
                  recognized as yours. Newsletters also have letterheads, they're
                  just called newsletter headers. 
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                  Your employees can have uniforms with the logo embroidered on
                  the lapel or hat. This way they are recognized in your locale
                  and also when they are out in the world. Make it a rule that
                  they cannot engage in unsightly behavior when wearing the
                  uniform. 
                </span>

            <li>
                <span>
                  The list goes on but essentially the point is that your logo
                  must be on all brand assets so that all your visual assets are
                  in tune and on-brand.

              Many Fiverr designers offer extra designs with your logo, like
              business cards, letterheads, social media headers or templates, and
              more. The variety depends on what the designer offers. Here is a

              When you have a logo that makes a positive first impression of your
              business, it will have a lasting effect. Use emotional branding to
              help boost the impact of your logo design and branding assets. Take
              your time to find the right designer for this task. You need to be
              sure that they will understand your brand values and what matters to
              you when it comes to your business logo.

              The design options for creating a logo. Even if you aren't creating
              the logo yourself, knowing these things can greatly improve your
              communication with a designer. When you understand the lingo, you
              will be more inclined to stay true to your values during the design
              process.

              How important your brand identity is to an emotional branding
              strategy and how your logo plays an important part in all your
              visual branding assets. This is another reason why it's important to
              have a good rapport with a designer, so they can tap into the deeper
              parts of your brand.

              We recommend you choose a designer that offers at least two or three
              revisions. That way it's easier to arrive at the best option for
              your brand. Your logo is as important as your branding message and
              they must go hand in hand. There are plenty of Fiverr designers who
              can design the perfect business logo for your brand. Remember to
              always ask designers questions to build communication early on.
