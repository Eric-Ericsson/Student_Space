                  as the coronavirus, as the main driving forces which push them
                  to get creative and look to online methods of earning their
                  income.

                  Your target audience is a group of individuals sharing similar
                  characteristics or needs that your online business is aiming to
                  serve. Therefore, they are most likely to purchase your products

              <p>
                <span>
                  Dropshipping is a partnership with a vendor that lets you list
                  their products on your online store. You then make a commission
                  for every sale you make, while the dropshipper is completely
                  responsible for stocking and shipping products. 
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Not only is it an effective option for starting a new online
                  business, but it also works in the vendor’s favor too, as you
                  are helping them expand the product catalog of their existing
                  store.

                      Many of the products offered by drop shippers are readily
                      available all over the internet, causing increased
                      competition

                      Dropshipping can give you a lower profit margin, so you’ll

                  From the very beginning, establish a clear plan for how to

                  communication via email, phone, or through an integrated system,
                  such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, where both
                  parties can update statuses and communicate back and forth.

                  system for communicating with your customers throughout the sale

                  We all know some products have greater potential to sell than
                  others, but how can you determine if your own products will have

                  The best trending e-commerce products all have three important
                  characteristics in common:

              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>

                      <b>Unique, authentic, and eye-catching. </b>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      The product you’re selling should be one-of-a-kind so the
                      demand for it is high. Ideally, customers shouldn’t be able
                      to purchase your product anywhere else online.

                    </span>
                    <span>
                      When a product is unique, it is also usually more difficult
                      to find. This increases customer demand for your product,
                      yet means you have little to no competition when it comes to
                      selling it, setting you up for success.

                </span>
                <span>
                  The ideal product will be one that you can sell within a good
                  profit margin, and this is where adopting a drop-shipping
                  solution becomes challenging as you will have to increase your
                  prices. Is it bad? That's not ideal but if you don't overdue you
                  might actually increase the customer’s perceived value of the
                  product

                  Your online business should have a brand style guide, which is
                  your rule book for how your brand is represented visually. It
                  helps maintain consistency with the look and feel of your brand,
                  especially when working with a graphic designer.

              <p>
                <span>
                  Along with the graphic design , other important elements of your
                  visual identity include UX (user experience) and UI (user
                  interface) design.

              <p>
                <span>
                  A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a
                  particular problem. For example, what steps do they need to take
                  in order to make a purchase? They focus on the overall feel of a
                  user’s experience when interacting with your brand.

                <span>
                  A UI designer, on the other hand, considers all the visual and
                  interactive elements of a product interface, including buttons,
                  icons, spacing, and responsive design. It’s also their job to
                  make sure the design is consistent, coherent, and aesthetically
                  pleasing.

                <span>
                  Your content is how you communicate with your customers, engage

              <p>
                <span>
                  Therefore, it’s important you determine the following

                      Awareness is the first time potential customers interact
                      with your products or services. It typically happens after
                      they begin online research for a problem they are trying to

                      are an expert in your industry. They may think you are the
                      right solution for their problem and are looking for
                      information to support that. At this point, they may have
                      expressed interest in your company by providing an email
                      address or following you on social media, but they haven't

                      Once the potential customer has expressed interest, you must
                      demonstrate that you are in fact an authority in your field
                      and an expert in your niche. You can do this through blog
                      posts and articles, case studies, or even offering a free
                      trial of your services to convince them you are the right
                      solution.

              </h3>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Starting an online business offers several clear advantages over
                  a traditional brick-and-mortar business. Here are four to keep
                  in mind. 
                </span>
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>
                  <b>1. Improved scalability</b>
                </span>
              </h4>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Scaling your business means you increase your output in a
                  cost-effective and reasonable way.
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  For example, if you own a brick-and-mortar retail clothing
                  store, scaling could mean opening a second store location. That
                  would involve finding a new location, renting or buying it,
                  hiring staff, filling the store with inventory, and paying the
                  ongoing costs (payroll, utilities, rent or mortgage, etc.).{" "}
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  The high upfront cost and delayed ROI are prohibitive for many
                  business owners. 
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  On the other hand, if your store was online-only, you could
                  scale without the need for such a large investment. You could
                  widen your product offerings while dropshipping them
                </span>
                <span>
                  so you don't need to pay for inventory upfront. You could grow
                  your social media organically. Further, you could invest in
                  advertising to increase the traffic to your website as it suits
                  your budget.
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  While scaling an online business does require some investment,
                  it's minimal compared to a traditional brick-and-mortar
                  business. 
                </span>
              </p>
              <h4>
                <span>
                  <b>2. High-profit margins and low overhead</b>
                </span>
              </h4>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Next, the low overhead doesn't just apply to scaling an online
                  business. You can also start one with minimal expenses as you
                  won't need retail space, an expensive office, furniture, or
                  inventory. Costs will vary depending on the type of online
                  business you open but can be very low. 
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  For example, if you start a service-based business offering
                  social media marketing , virtual assistance, writing, web
                  development, or graphic design, you could build a social
                  presence for free and a low-cost website for as little as $100.
                  All you need is your skillset, a computer, and an internet

                  If you decide to sell products, you could set up a low-cost
                  website, social profiles, and a dropshipping system. Working
                  online eliminates many of the costs that come with a physical

                  Ever see those people working on their laptops from a tropical
                  island with their toes in the sand? That could literally be you
                  if you start an online business. Working solely online gives you
                  the freedom to live and work from anywhere in the world — as

                  While running a successful business of any sort requires
                  organization and hard work, you won't be confined to certain
                  work hours or an office in a particular location. In many cases,
                  you can set your own work hours around the times that work best
                  for you.

                  boss first!
