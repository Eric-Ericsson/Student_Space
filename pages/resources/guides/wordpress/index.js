            WordPress is a popular open-source content management system (CMS).
            Open source means that the code for WordPress is completely open and
            everyone can see precisely how it works. This makes it possible for
            housands of experts to audit the code to make sure it's secure;
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two ways to get WordPress: Installing it yourself at a web
            host (called <i>self-hosted WordPress</i>) or paying for a
            subscription at WordPress.com which is the commercial offering of
            WordPress.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this guide, we'll be talking about installing it yourself (it's
            super easy!) because self-hosted installations have a lot more
            flexibility.WordPress is highly extensible. The platform was designed
            around a concept called "plugins." These are small pieces of
            independent code that enhance WordPress's basic functionality. Many of
            the plugins are free and they offer everything from search engine
            optimization (SEO) to social media tools to contact forms and
            countless other additional features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Installing these plugins is as easy as searching the WordPress
              plugin repository and clicking "Install." We'll dig into precisely
              how to do this below.

              It isn't necessary to hire an expert to manage your WordPress site,
              but many businesses hire freelancers. Freelancers can quickly add
              highly sophisticated features to your WordPress site at a fraction
              of the cost of agencies or full-time employees. WordPress’s design
              makes this extremely simple.

              WordPress allows small businesses to run an enterprise-grade website
              platform without enterprise-level investment. As of 2021, WordPress
              was already powering 40% of the internet And the platform powers
              nearly 30% of the world's top 1 million websites.

              In the past, setting up WordPress was a bit of a nightmare for
              people with no web development experience. You needed to download
              the package, extract the files, upload them, create a
              database... 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Fortunately, web hosts have made it, so you don't need to go through
              these hassles. Basically, most hosts offer you an easy wizard to set
              up your WordPress website. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>That's the easy part.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              It's the maintenance that’s a headache, and often requires the help
              of a web developer.

            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>For example, Hostinger offers the following packages:</span>

              Additionally, by looking at Hostgator's pricing for shared Linux

              Be sure to read the fine print. The discounts above are only valid
              for the first invoice. So the Business Plan, which is the only one
              offering unlimited websites, will be $17.95 a month after the first
              month. The domain is also only free in the first year.

              There are millions of domains in the world. One of the largest
              challenges these days is to find a dot com domain that hasn't been
              taken.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              The ending of the domain — .com, .eu, .net — is called the TLD, or
              Top Level Domain. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              The .com TLD is considered widely generic and commercial. I
              recommend trying to find a domain that ends in .com. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              You will likely need to test a few options to find one that is
              available. If you absolutely hate the .com domain you find, you can
              try a custom TLD such as .site, .club, .company, and so one.

              It's no secret that WordPress can have its quirks. The platform's
              extreme flexibility means that it can be a little troublesome
              sometimes. But the reason it's the most popular CMS in the world is
              precisely because it's so incredibly versatile and scales
              phenomenally. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              The "quirks" usually don't happen if you stick with the default
              theme and install zero plugins. But if you wanted simplicity over
              flexibility, you probably would have chosen Squarespace over WordPress

              WordPress's power comes from the fact that it has over 10,000 free
              themes to choose from, and more than 60,000 plugins!

            <span>Themes are a piece of cake if you like them <i>exactly </i>  as they are. But people often want to customize them  . If you are not a web developer, that can get frustrating. And, a
              common problem with WordPress is that too many plugins and themes
              can result in conflicts, requiring web debugging</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              It's not as simple as saying, "Oh, just uninstall the plugin that is
              causing the conflict!" Some of those plugins are crucial for your website's success in search engines.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>For example, so-called "caching" plugins are vital for speeding up a website. This is an important search engine ranking factor. But these plugins are notorious for their potential to "break"
              certain other plugins.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Two ways around this are to:</span>

            <li>
                <span>
                  Go by trial and error, installing and uninstalling plugins as
                  needed to see which work best on your site. This is a valid
                  strategy if you're strapped on budget and have some time on your
                  hands. 
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>The other option is to hire an expert website specialist who knows which plugins work best with other plugins and themes.
                  This will save you both time and money in the long term.</span>

            <span>Wordpress Themes: The Bad</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span>
              All right, let's look at the potential "bad" for WordPress themes,
              and how to resolve it:: 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Things start to get complicated when you need to:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                  Download and install a theme from an external repository. (This
                  is more common than you might think because external
                  repositories hold excellent premium themes.)
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Customize the theme more than its options allow.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Debug the theme. </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              Like all things WordPress, the developers have gone out of their way
              to make it possible for non-programmers to customize and tweak
              things. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But because something is possible doesn't mean it's easy. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Every theme offers unique customization options. Some let you
              customize the colors and font. Others let you specify the layout of
              the theme. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              To access all the customization options, go to "Appearance" →
              "Customize" on the left menu of the admin section. 
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>A few things can go wrong here:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                  The page looks different on the customization page than it does
                  when you're viewing the live version. 
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>The option you want changed doesn't exist. </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>
              Because I am a programmer by training, I always rolled up my sleeves
              to try and "hack" themes to make them work. But, let me tell you,
              this is extremely frustrating! It is also phenomenally
              time-consuming! Now that I am a full time writer, I just don't have
              the time to do it, and my skills have become outdated. It's much
              faster to just hire a pro who is involved in the WordPress scene and
              knows what they're doing. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Sometimes, you find a theme that is "almost" right, but not quite.
              In that case, it is possible to create a "child theme" that builds
              on the main theme. A programmer can code this child theme and get it
              up and running much faster than if they were creating an entirely
              new theme from scratch.

              on their own terms, has personally built over 50 websites using
              WordPress. He suggests the following strategy regarding themes:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              "The great thing about WordPress is that you can use a child theme
              or theme framework like GeneratePress that gives you the ability to
              start with a template that you can build and customize off of. Most
              of my websites use a child theme and I hire a freelance web
              developer to customize it based upon the functionality that I need."
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Another powerful option to customize WordPress themes is to use a
              Wordpress page/theme builder plugin such as Elementor or Oxygen Page
              Builder. This lets you customize any WordPress theme using a
              drag-and-drop editor. It's well-suited for people with no coding
              experience. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>And that brings us to the "ugly." </span>
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span>WordPress themes: The ugly</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span>
              And then there is the possibility that a particular
              theme-plugin-combination conflicts and brings your entire site down.
              This sometimes happens when you update a plugin or theme. It worked
              yesterday and then, bam, your site is broken!
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              This puts people in a catch-22 regarding maintenance: It's crucial
              to regularly update WordPress because the vast majority of hacks the
              platform suffers come from outdated plugins. But updating the site
              can also "break" it. 
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>So, what do you do?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              As mentioned previously, a bit of programming knowledge can end up
              costing you a lot more in lost time. It is much easier to hire
              someone at a reasonable cost to do the website maintenance for you,
              or to jump in to{" "}

              The good, bad, and ugly of WordPress plugins is very similar to
              themes: You have an enormous choice, and each can bring tremendous
              value to the site. But too much of a good thing can result in:
            </span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Plugin/theme conflicts</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                  Potential security holes if they are not regularly maintained

              WordPress is not a "create and forget" platform. It needs to be

              Backups are vital because, if something ever goes wrong with an
              update, you can always revert to a backup. There are both automated
              and semi-automated WordPress backup solutions.

              Lots of plugins can result in website slowness. This can have a poor

              how busy your site is.
